上海大学开源社区是由上海大学的开源技术爱好者于 2010 年自主发起成立的非营利性学生组织，面向全校师生传播开源理念，并提供排课助手等公共服务。校内同学与往届成员保持密切的联系，开展各式各样的技术交流。除了在校内开展社团活动，我们还与校外企业和开源组织密切合作，积极号召学生志愿者参加各类开源技术活动，在沪上具有广泛影响力。

Shanghai University Open Source Community (SHUOSC) is a non-profit student organization founded by open source enthusiasts at Shanghai University in 2010. We promote open source culture and provide public services such as course scheduling helper to our classmates. Students on campus maintain close connection with alumni and organize various technical events frequently. As one of the most influential open source organizations in Shanghai, we also work closely with off-campus companies and organizations, and actively call for student volunteers to participate in various technical events.
